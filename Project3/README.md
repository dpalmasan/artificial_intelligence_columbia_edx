# Project 3

These are my solutions for the project 3. The project consisted on implementing Perceptron Learning Algorithm, Linear Regression, and using sklearn library for classifying tasks:

* problem1.py: Implements Perceptron Learning algorithm. It also has a visualizer for debugging (Can be enabled editing the code).
* problem2.py: Implements Linear Regression with preprocessing (centering and scaling data).
* problem3.py: Uses sklearn for a classifying task. It split the data into training and test set using stratified sampling, and then, given a list of parameters
and using 5-fold cross validation, search for the best model.
* problem3_visualize.py: Plot the decision boundaries of models found in problem3.py.

##To execute the codes:

`python problem1.py <input.csv> <output.csv>`

`python problem2.py <input.csv> <output.csv>`

`python problem3.py`

`python problem3_visualize.py`
